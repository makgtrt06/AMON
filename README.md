DESCRIPTION

First of all, this project was done throughout a school year and made by students, so its specifications and devolopments may not be perfect. 

To create this project we used two preojects which previously made a similar approach to our idea: 

- The first one, the <a href="https://github.com/spenceraxani/CosmicWatch-Desktop-Muon-Detector-v2">Cosmic Watch </a>project which we used it's scintillators and the general idea for the project
- The second project, <a href="https://github.com/OpenGammaProject/Open-Gamma-Detector">Open Gamma</a> project which its version 2 schematic was used in our project

We would like to thank both the creators of this project for answering our questions and helping us whith our project.



Most of our project is explained in our PDR, found here in the main branch, there you can see how the project was made and developed.


For further questions contact us via email, found in our web page, or directly to this repository. For more specific questions about the muon detection you can contact the representatives of the CosmicWatch and Open Gamma projects.
